🎯 4. Key Technical Achievements
Mathematical Correctness
✅ Sphere Constraint Verification
rust// Correctly validates: Σ(r_i²) = R²
// Handles tolerance for numerical precision
// Tests cover 2D, 3D, N-D cases
✅ N-Dimensional Swap Calculation
rust// Solves: (r_i + Δ_in)² + ... + (r_j - Δ_out)² = R²
// Works for any N ≥ 2
// Handles edge cases (zero amounts, insufficient liquidity)
✅ Price Calculations
rust// Instantaneous price: P = r_i / r_j
// Price impact: |P_after - P_before| / P_before
// Scales correctly with precision (10^18)
Code Quality
✅ Error Handling

No unwraps in production code
All errors have context
