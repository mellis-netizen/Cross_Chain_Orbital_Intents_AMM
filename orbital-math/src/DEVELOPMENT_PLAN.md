⚠️ Limitations of Current Implementation

Not True Orbital: Current AMM is a traditional xy=k with virtual reserves, not the spherical/toroidal invariant
2D Only: No support for N-dimensional pools (3+ stablecoins)
No Tick System: Lacks concentrated liquidity ranges
Missing Superellipse: No flattened curve for 1:1 stablecoin trading
Limited Cross-Chain: Basic bridge abstraction without optimal routing

Development Phases

Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation (Week 1-2)
1.1 Implement Core Orbital Math Library
Location: core/orbital-math/
Components:

Spherical Invariant Module (sphere.rs)

N-dimensional sphere constraint: Σ(ri²) = R²
Polar decomposition: perpendicular and parallel components
Geodesic distance calculations


Superellipse Module (superellipse.rs)

Superellipse invariant: Σ(|ri|^u) = constant
Parameter u for curve shaping (u > 2 for flattening)
Optimized for stablecoin trading around 1:1


Tick Geometry Module (ticks.rs)

Hyperplane boundary definitions
Spherical cap calculations
Tick nesting and overlap logic
Capital efficiency computations


Trade Execution Module (trades.rs)

Toroidal invariant formula
Quartic equation solver for swaps
Tick boundary crossing detection
Trade segmentation algorithm



Key Algorithms:
rust// Spherical constraint
fn verify_sphere_constraint(reserves: &[U256], radius_squared: U256) -> bool;

// Superellipse constraint  
fn verify_superellipse_constraint(reserves: &[U256], u_param: f64, k: U256) -> bool;

// Calculate amount out using toroidal invariant
fn calculate_swap_toroidal(
    reserves: &[U256],
    token_in: usize,
    token_out: usize,
    amount_in: U256,
    interior_ticks: &[Tick],
    boundary_ticks: &[Tick],
) -> Result<U256, OrbitalError>;

// Detect tick crossing during trade
fn detect_tick_crossing(
    start_point: &ReservePoint,
    end_point: &ReservePoint,
    ticks: &[Tick],
) -> Option<TickCrossing>;

    ticks: Vec<TickData>,                    // Sorted by boundary distance
    active_ticks_bitmap: U256,               // Efficient tick filtering
