## Critical Performance Issues

### 🔴 Issue #1: Route Optimization Latency

**Problem**: Route optimization operations take 200-300ms, significantly impacting user experience.

**Root Cause**: 
- Inefficient algorithm complexity (O(n³) in worst case)
- Lack of caching for frequently requested routes
- Excessive memory allocations during calculation

**Impact**: 
- 15% of users experience >300ms delays
- Solver reputation scores affected by slow responses
- Higher gas costs due to suboptimal routes

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. Implement route caching with LRU eviction (30-50% improvement expected)
2. Optimize algorithm to O(n log n) using A* pathfinding
3. Pre-compute common routes during off-peak hours
4. Add route approximation for time-sensitive requests

### 🟡 Issue #2: Database Connection Pool Contention

**Problem**: Database connections experience occasional timeouts under high load.

**Root Cause**:
- Connection pool size (50) insufficient for peak load
- Long-running queries blocking connection pool
- Missing connection health checks

**Impact**:
- 1.1% of database operations fail with timeout
- Cascading failures in intent processing
- User experience degradation during peak hours

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. Increase connection pool size to 100
2. Implement query timeout and retry logic
3. Add connection health monitoring
4. Optimize slow queries (>100ms)

### 🟡 Issue #3: Memory Usage Spikes

**Problem**: Memory usage spikes to 400MB+ during complex multi-chain operations.

**Root Cause**:
- Large data structures for route calculation
- Inefficient object cloning
- Memory leaks in WebSocket connection handling

**Impact**:
- Potential OOM errors under extreme load
- Increased GC pressure affecting performance
- Higher infrastructure costs

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. Implement object pooling for frequently used structures
2. Use compact data representations
3. Add memory usage monitoring and alerts
4. Optimize WebSocket connection lifecycle management
